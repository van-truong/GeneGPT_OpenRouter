        "To find the official gene symbol of LMP10, we can use the NCBI E-utilities API to search the gene database. Specifically, we will use the `esearch` utility to find the gene ID associated with the term \"LMP10\". Then, we can use the `esummary` utility to retrieve the official gene symbol.\n\nHere is how you can perform these steps:\n\n1. **Search for the gene ID of LMP10:**\n\n   Use the `esearch` utility to search the gene database for \"LMP10\":\n\n   ```\n   https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=gene&term=LMP10\n   ```\n\n2. **Retrieve the official gene symbol:**\n\n   Once you have the gene ID from the `esearch` result, use the `esummary` utility to get the gene summary, which includes the official gene symbol:\n\n   ```\n   https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi?db=gene&id={gene_id}\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to find the official gene symbol for LMP10.
