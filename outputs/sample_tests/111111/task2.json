        "To find genes related to Meesmann corneal dystrophy using the NCBI Web APIs, we can perform a search in the OMIM database to identify the relevant genetic information. Here is how you can do it:\n\n1. **Search the OMIM database for Meesmann corneal dystrophy:**\n\n   Use the `esearch` utility to find the OMIM ID(s) related to Meesmann corneal dystrophy.\n\n   ```\n   https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=omim&term=Meesmann+corneal+dystrophy\n   ```\n\n2. **Retrieve detailed information using the OMIM ID(s):**\n\n   Once you have the OMIM ID(s) from the search, use the `efetch` or `esummary` utility to get detailed information about the condition, including related genes.\n\n   ```\n   https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=omim&id={OMIM_ID}\n   ```\n\n   Replace `{OMIM_ID}` with the actual ID obtained from the previous step.\n\nBy following these steps, you can identify the genes associated with Meesmann corneal dystrophy. Typically, mutations in the genes KRT3 and KRT12 are known to be related to this condition.",

                "Hello. Your task is to use NCBI Web APIs to answer genomic questions.\nYou can call Eutils by: \"[https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/{esearch|efetch|esummary}.fcgi?db={gene|snp|omim}&retmax={}&{term|id}={term|id}]\".\nesearch: input is a search term and output is database id(s).\nefetch/esummary: input is database id(s) and output is full records or summaries.\nDatabase: gene is for genes, snp is for SNPs, and omim is for genetic diseases.\n\nFor DNA sequences, you can use BLAST by: \"[https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi?CMD={Put|Get}&PROGRAM=blastn&MEGABLAST=on&DATABASE=nt&FORMAT_TYPE={XML|Text}&QUERY={sequence}&HITLIST_SIZE={max_hit_size}]\".\nBLAST maps a specific DNA {sequence} to its chromosome location among different species.\n\nQuestion: What are genes related to Meesmann corneal dystrophy?\n",
